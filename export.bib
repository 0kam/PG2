   abstract = {Alpine landscapes are projected to be degraded under climate change, which would threaten their benefits to society. Previous studies, however, have been limited to aesthetic change, and it remains unclear how much the aesthetic change would affect human welfare. To address this issue and gain insights into climate change adaptation policies, we conducted a choice experiment survey using digitally manipulated images based on climate change scenarios and natural scientific knowledge in a mountainous national park in Japan. We uncovered that park visitors appreciate the alpine landscapes that include snow patches on mountains and some types of alpine flowers by analyzing the data from 445 respondents. Conversely, both the invasion of alpine vegetation by dwarf bamboo and the disappearance of snow patches due to climate change substantially deteriorated the perceived aesthetic benefits from alpine landscapes. The economic loss caused by climate-induced landscape degradation was estimated at more than 100 USD per visitor, at maximum; the disappearance of snow patches and invasion by dwarf bamboo reduced the benefits by approximately 13 USD and 101 USD, respectively. Our findings suggest that sustaining the aesthetic value of alpine landscapes in national parks via climate change adaptation has potentially significant economic benefits. By supposing that the mountain national park attracts 70,000 visitors in summer, climate change would cause as a minimum of eight million USD economic loss at the park without appropriate measures annually. Our findings highlight the importance of climate change measures by considering climate change impacts on social benefits associated with alpine landscapes.},

   abstract = {The dwarf bamboo Sasa kurilensis has responded to recent climate change by expanding its distribution into alpine snow meadows in Japan. Tall, dense clonal patches of bamboo suppress alpine plant growth, alter ecosystem functioning, and reduce diversity. We aim to assess the ecological impacts of bamboo expansion and the effectiveness of bamboo control for restoring alpine vegetation and species diversity. We quantified the extent of bamboo expansion, its effects on an alpine ecosystem, and the recovery of species diversity by bamboo removal over 6 years in Daisetsuzan National Park, northern Japan. We established paired, experimental plots assigned to either removal or control treatments following an encroaching gradient from interior to terminal locations in a large bamboo patch. We monitored bamboo development and aboveground production, and its impact on soil moisture and species diversity to assess the recovery process of snow meadow species after its removal. In control plots, bamboo density consistently increased and accumulated biomass from year to year. In the removal treatment, bamboo culm density, height and biomass decreased through time at all locations. Furthermore, soil moisture increased in the removal plots and remained consistently higher than controls throughout the growing season. Dwarf bamboo strongly suppressed alpine plants and reduced species diversity. However, alpine snow meadow species rapidly recovered and diversity increased through time in the removal treatment. This study presents an effective management strategy for restoring alpine plant diversity impacted by bamboo expansion under global climate change.},

   abstract = {The cryosphere (including, snow, glaciers, permafrost, lake and river ice) is an integral element of high- mountain regions, which are home to roughly 10% of the global population. Widespread cryosphere changes affect physical, biological and human systems in the mountains and surrounding lowlands, with impacts evident even in the ocean. Building on the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), this chapter assesses new evidence on observed recent and projected changes in the mountain cryosphere as well as associated impacts, risks and adaptation measures related to natural and human systems. Impacts in response to climate changes independently of changes in the cryosphere are not assessed in this chapter. Polar mountains are included in Chapter 3, except those in Alaska and adjacent Yukon, Iceland, and Scandinavia, which are included in this chapter. },

   abstract = {Question: Alpine vegetation is sensitive to climate change, with shifts in species ranges, changes in community composition, and an upward shift in the forest limit over decades. Under climate change, habitats suitable for alpine vegetation will progressively decrease in scale, making their protection and conservation particularly important. In the Taisetsu Mountains of Japan, alpine vegetation has changed remarkably during the last decade. The aim of this study was to estimate the distribution of habitats suitable for alpine and subalpine vegetation types (snowbeds, shrubs, and alpine heathland/fellfield) and competing vegetation types (Sasa spp. and subarctic forest), while considering uncertainties in future predictions and climate scenarios. Location: Taisetsu Mountains, Daisetsuzan National Park, Hokkaido (northern Japan). Methods: We estimated the habitat area suitable for each vegetation type from current vegetation maps on the basis of the predictions by three global climate models (GCMs) under two climate change scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) using five habitat suitability models (HSMs) in two periods (2046-2050 and 2096-2100). We also compared the performances of the HSMs. Results: Mean summer temperature and snow-cover period had significant effects on the distribution of all vegetation types. The estimated distribution area for suitable habitat did not differ markedly among GCMs and HSMs. Under the RCP2.6 scenario, habitats suitable for snowbeds and alpine heathland/fellfield drastically decreased overall but were preserved in some regions. Under the RCP8.5 scenario, however, subarctic forest almost completely replaced alpine and subalpine vegetation types over time. Conclusions: Our projections indicate that the severity of future climate change will determine whether or not habitats suitable for alpine vegetation will remain. Monitoring the dynamics of endemic and rare species for the effects of global warming should be the priority for adaptation strategies to enable timely conservation measures.},

@article{Kudo2011EcoEvo,
   abstract = {Recently, a dwarf bamboo species, Sasa kurilensis; Poaceae, has invaded into alpine snow-meadows in the wilderness area of the Taisetsu Mountains, northern Japan. This dwarf bamboo species has a wide distribution range from lowland to alpine sites of snowy regions. Because of the formation of dense evergreen culms and an extensive rhizome system, other plants are excluded following invasion by this dwarf bamboo, resulting in low species diversity. Dwarf bamboo originally inhabited the leeward slopes of alpine dwarf pine (Pinus pumila) clumps in alpine regions. During the last 32 years, however, dwarf bamboo has expanded its distribution area by up to 47% toward snow-meadows, especially on southeastern facing slopes. This rapid change may be related to the decrease in soil moisture and expansion of the annual growing period caused by the recent acceleration of snowmelt time. A multiyear census revealed that the density of bamboo culms increased 30-150% during 2 years, and the annual expansion of bamboo rhizomes was 39 cmon average. In addition to the expansion of bamboo clumps by vegetative growth, the possibility of migration by seed dispersal was also suggested by a genet analysis. With the increase in culm density, the species richness of snow-meadow vegetation decreased to less than one-quarter of the original level due to intense shading by dwarf bamboo. The rapid vegetation change in these almost pristine alpine environments isolated from the human activity implies that global climate change already influences the alpine ecosystem. © 2011 The Authors.},
